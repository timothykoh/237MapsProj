News World is an interactive map for visualizing where news is happening around the world.
Clicking any of the category buttons pulls news and plots on a map where it happens; using specific search terms allows you to narrow your search. Where available, picture thumbnails are used so you can see what the news is about at a glance. Hovering over each icon or thumbnail displays a brief summary of the news article and displays relevant social media feeds on the sidebar, and clicking opens the full article for viewing.
