News World is an interactive map for visualizing where news is happening around the world.
Clicking any of the category buttons pulls news and plots on a map where it happens; using specific search terms allows you to narrow your search. Where available, picture thumbnails are used so you can see what the news is about at a glance. Hovering over each icon or thumbnail displays a brief summary of the news article and displays relevant social media feeds on the sidebar, and clicking opens the full article for viewing.

Required elements used:
Javascript - Javascript was used throughout the project.
Canvas - used to make an animated progress bar displaying the status of the news article queue.
HTML - the page was designed mainly using divs with a form for the search bar.
CSS - reset used, fluid layout, :hover property on category buttons; all styling was done in CSS.
DOM manipulation - used to create content of tooltips displayed when hovering on news icons.
AJAX and/or JSON-P client - JSON-P was used to pull news from the New York Times and Guardian APIs and the Twitter and Facebook APIs.
jQuery - used in the JavaScript for handling social media requests.
